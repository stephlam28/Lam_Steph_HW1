### I grew up in Guelph, Ontario and lived here my whole life with my family, I have 2 older brothers, one who got married recently in 2022.

#### I love watching animations, especially by Studio Ghibli, art is something that brings happiness and serenity to me.

#### My favourite movie from Studio Ghibli would be *Howl's Moving Castle*. The creation of the music, art and story-telling is immaculate.

#### I love spending time with my family, this picture was taken recently during New Years Eve,
