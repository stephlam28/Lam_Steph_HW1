### I grew up in Guelph, Ontario and lived here my whole life.

#### I love watching animations, especially by Studio Ghibli, art is something that brings happiness and serenity to me.

#### My favourite movie from Studio Ghibli would be Howl's Moving Castle. The creation of the music, art and story-telling is immaculate.
