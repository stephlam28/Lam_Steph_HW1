        <p> Hello! My name is Stephanie. I am 22 and recently graduated with a diploma from Sheridan College, 
            now pursuing a diploma for Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I enjoy travelling, gaming and reading. </p>
        <p> When I travel, I love places with warm weather and beautiful sceneries. I have many locations I wish to visit, my top 3 would be Switzerland, Japan and Korea all due to
            the great culture and amazing sceneries. My favourite visited location so far has been Oranjestad, Aruba. </p>
        <!--insert image of aruba trip-->
        <p> I started playing games at a young age and have carried onto my present. On my free time, I play PC games with friends. Games ranging from MMOs like Maplestory,
            to FPS like Valorant, Overwatch or MOBAs like League of Legends and many more! </p>
