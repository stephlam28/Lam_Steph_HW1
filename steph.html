        <p class="p"> Hello! My name is Stephanie. I am 22 and recently graduated with a diploma from Sheridan College in Office Administration, 
            now pursuing a diploma for Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I grew up in Guelph, Ontario and lived here my whole life with my family, I have 2 older brothers, one who got married recently in 2022.
            <br>
            <br> My main hobbies include gaming and reading. I enjoy travelling, painting, and photography as well. 
            <br>
            <br> When I travel, it tends to be with family. I love places with warm weather and beautiful sceneries. 
            I have many locations I wish to visit, my top 3 would be Switzerland, Japan and Korea all due to
            the great culture and amazing sceneries. My favourite visited location so far has been Oranjestad, Aruba. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="p2"> I started playing games at a young age and have carried onto my present. On my free time, I play PC games with friends. Games ranging from MMOs like Maplestory,
            to FPS like Valorant, Overwatch or MOBAs like League of Legends and many more! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I love watching animations, especially by Studio Ghibli, art is something that brings happiness and serenity to me.
            My favourite movie from Studio Ghibli would be <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em>. The creation of the music, art and story-telling is immaculate.
            I love spending time with my family and friends as well.
